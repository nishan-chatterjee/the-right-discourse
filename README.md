## Contents:

### Interactive Plots:

[**Discover the interactive plots here**](https://nishan-chatterjee.github.io/the-right-discourse/), which showcase our project's data visualizations. These plots are a part of the [docs](docs/) directory and offer a hands-on experience with our findings.

### Notebooks:

The final code used for topic modeling is available in the [`topic-modeling-with-llama2.ipynb`](notebooks/topic-modeling-with-llama2.ipynb) notebook. This code is adapted from the BERTopic library, accessible [here](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html).

### Persuasion Detection:

For persuasion detection, we utilized our submission from whatdoyoumeme at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Cross-lingual Persuasion Detection using Label Hierarchy and Translated Texts. Model weights will be soon made available on HuggingFace.

Stay tuned for updates!
